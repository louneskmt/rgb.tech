happy to announce v0.7 release of RGB v0.7, which provides a milestone\nof the recent RGB developments which include:\n\nFull taproot-based OP_RETURN commitments (tapret)\nNew multi-protocol

If you think about blockchain as a settlement layer and\nLightning as a scaling layers, RGB is the programmability layer, finally\nadding to the first and most censorship-resistant cryptographic-based store of\nvalue properties which were absent and desired for many years.\nRGB achieves this though a separation of abstraction layers: the bitcoin\nblockchain (layer 1) becomes a cryptographic commitment layer, which holds\nno data but a compact commitments to the smart contract state, which is\nnow kept off-chain.

This helps to simplify life of asset \nissuers and normies, who just need to issue a token, create their self-sovereign\nidentity, run a DAO etc.\nThis is achieved through separation of concerns, where the development work is\nkept outside contracts, thanks to things named schema and interface.\n\nContract\nThe contract is a contract genesis plus a history of operations on the\ncontract. Together they are used by RGB to compute a deterministic contract\nstate. To create a contract means to issue a contract genesis, which \nrequires no code at all. Contract issuer just needs to pick a schema\nwhich has all features he needs in a contract – and use it during the \nissuance. If the schema with the required properties doesn't exist, issuer\ncan hire a developer to implement such schema.\n\nSchema\nIf you think in terms of objective-oriented programming (OOP), contract is\nan instance of some class, and in RGB terms this class is named\nschema. Schema contains all contract business logic, scripts, \ndefinitions of state types (owned and global), allowed operations, rules\nfor validation, data type system etc. Schema by its nature is declarative,\nthis it can be easily read or written with rust macros, YAML, TOML and other\ndeclarative languages.

As classes can\nimplement interfaces in Java, or structs can implement traits in Rust,\nin RGB schema can implement many interfaces.\n\n\n","id":"https://rgb.tech/program/components/","title":"Components"},"https://rgb.tech/program/contractum/":{"body":"","id":"https://rgb.tech/program/contractum/","title":"Programming with Contractum"},"https://rgb.tech/program/contractum/basics/":{"body":"The best way to understand RGB is through example. Let's do a contract which\nwill work as a digital identity.\nWe have to start with definition of a data type representing the key. This is\nnot a part of the contract itself and may be imported into multiple contracts\nfrom a data type library.\ndata PgpKey :: curve U8, key Bytes\n\nAS you might see, the code looks similar to Haskel. New data types are declared\nwith data keyword, and can be composed of named fields (being structs),\nunnamed fields (tuples), operate as enums (in this case you should use\n| instead of ,), or unions, where each variant may in turn have an\nassociated structure or tuple. You may read more about constructing data types\nin strict types guidelines.\nNow, having the data type we can start definition of our schema:\nschema DecentralizedIdentity\n   -- This defines the atom of the contract state called `Identity`\n   -- which has data type `PgpKey`.\n   -- The `owned` keyword means that there is always a party\n   -- which owns the identity\n   owned Identity :: PgpKey\n   -- an implicit part of the story is the fact that owned state\n   -- is always assigned to a single-use-seal definition, so the\n   -- proper way of writing the above statement will be\n   owned Identity :: SingleUseSeal -&gt; PgpKey\n   -- but we leave the part which repeats for each and every owned\n   -- state to reduce boilerplate of writing `SingleUseSeal -&gt;`\n   -- over and over again.\n\n   -- This says that to construct contract the user must provide\n   -- information about exactly one identity\n   genesis :: Identity\n\n   -- Now let's define what a owner of identity can do,\n   -- He can execute his rights by creating state transitions\n   -- (\"operation\" on the state) of predefined forms, like\n   op Revocation :: old Identity -&gt; new Identity\n   -- which does what it says: it revokes existing identity\n   -- and creates a new one.\n\nAs you may see, schema declares state which the contract operates, and\noperations, which may update the state.\nThe state can be global and owned. The difference between these two forms of\nstate can be illustrated with following statements:\n\n\nGlobal state: nobody owns, everyone knows\nExamples: asset name\n\n\nOwned state: someone owns, nobody else knows\nExamples: asset amounts, voting rights, NFT content\n\n\nIn our example we do not define a global state yet.\nThere are also three types of operations:\n\nGenesis - a unique operation which takes no input and sets up the contract;\nState transition, which changes some existing owned state (\"inputs\") and\nmay add up to the global state;\nState extensions, which may be seen as a \"decentralized additional\ngeneses\". State extensions do not have input state, but may produce new owned\nstate.\n\nThe schema defines a rules of how the contract operates. Now let's put it into\na practice by creating a specific identity contract, and then doing a revocation:\ncontract meSatoshiNakamoto implements DecentralizedIdentity\n  -- this defines a genesis state and assigns it to a single-use-seal\n  assign orig Identity := \n    (0xfac503c4641c3deda72a2d00bc9d6ff1094b15276c386efea403746a91436772, 1)\n    -&gt; PgpKey(0, 0x028730eeeec41802621d177507b086f390ae600ba3ca5e428b13913af4c2cd25b3)\n\ntransition iLostMyKey executes Revocation\n  -- specifies the single-use-seal we close to match requirements\n  -- on the valid operation execution conditions\n  via meSatoshiNakamoto.orig\n  \n  -- here we use txid of the bitcoin transaction which will be\n  -- created to hold the commitment to this state transition,\n  -- called \"single-use-seal witness\". Since we can not know the\n  -- txid upfront we use ~ to indicate the witness transaction id\n  assign upd Identity := (~, 2) \n   -&gt; PgpKey(0, 0x0219db0a4e0eb8cb833608c08d76b9b279ec44a851ab82cc6fd68a9b32624bfa8b)\n   -- the above defines new state and assigns it to a single-use-seal\n\n","id":"https://rgb.tech/program/contractum/basics/","title":"Writing simple contract"},"https://rgb.tech/program/contractum/fungibles/":{"body":"Now, let's add some tokens to the contract, in form of \"I owe you\" obligations\nprovided by the decentralized identity:\nschema DecentralizedIdentity\n   owned Identity :: PgpKey\n   owned IOYIssue :: Zk64\n   -- `Zk64` means 64-bit unsigned integer hidden with zero-knowledge\n   owned IOYTokens :: Zk64\n\n   global IOYTicker :: String\n   global IOYName :: String\n\n   genesis :: Identity, IOYTicker, IOYName\n\n   op Revocation :: old Identity -&gt; new Identity\n\n   op Promise :: used IOYIssue -&gt; given [IOYTokens]?, remaining IOYIssue?\n      assert used == sum given + (remaining ?? 0)\n\n   op Transfer :: spent {IOYTokens} -&gt; received [IOYTokens]\n      assert sum spent == sum received\n\nHere we see multiple new things, let's try to explain them one by one.\nFirst, it is the global keyword used to define asset ticker and name as two\nstrings.\nWe already covered owned state composed of the rights holder and state atoms;\nbut in some situations a contract needs a state which is \"global\" for the\ncontract and is not \"owned\" by anyone (i.e. not assigned to a UTXO\nsingle-use-seal). The name of the asset (and ticker) is that sort of\ninformation: in the examples above it does not \"belong\" to a contract party but\ninstead is a \"property\" of the contract itself. Another example could be the\nname of the identity holder which can't be changed and thus can't be assigned to\na UTXO single-use-seal. Such state is defined with the global keyword.\nIt is important to note, that while the global state is not \"directly owned\" by\nany party, it still may be updated through state transitions -- but only if\nschema enables that explicitly. In such cases the use of the global state (as\ncompared to the owned state) is reasonable only when the user may opt-out from\nfuture state updates (i.e. do not define a new single-use-seals) but still needs\nto keep the state. The asset name is again such an example, since even if the\nasset can be renamed, future renames after certain renaming may be prohibited\n(i.e. no new owned state can be created), but the asset name should stay.\nglobal allows exactly that.\nSecond, the use of braces, brackets and question mark around and next to the\nstate name. Both braces and brackets mean that the operation works not with a\nsingle state atom, but instead an array (braces) or set (brackets) of state\natoms. Set differs from an array in the fact that all elements of the set must\nbe unique, while in array they may repeat. Coming back to our operations, asset\ntransfer may spend a number of assets from different owners, but all of them\nmust be unique (to prevent double-spend), i.e. form a set. However, when\ndefining a receivers, multiple state atoms may be equal (i.e. you can send\n10 tokens to the same UTXO N times, such that the receiver will get 10*N\ntokens in total, but through different \"inputs\", which may increase privacy).\nQuestion mark is used to inform that the state may be absent, i.e. in case of\narray or set it can be empty - or in case of a single item, it is optional.\nAt the very beginning we had mentioned so-called state extensions. State\nextension can be created by anybody without doing an on-chain commitment (i.e.\nwithout closing any single-use-seals). In this it is similar to genesis.\nHowever, the state created by the extension is not \"final\" (compare to a\nnon-mined transaction in the bitcoin mempool) until it gets included into a\nvalid state transition (like transaction gets mined by being included into\nbitcoin valid block).\nProbably the simplest way to understand state extensions is by example. Let's\nassume we'd like to do an asset which can be issued by anybody in the world\nthrough burning equivalent amount of bitcoins. Such operation can't be a state\ntransition, since we do not have a predefined set of single-use-seals to define\na \"rights of issue\" for an open and unknown set of participants. We can't also\ndo \"multiple geneses\", since each genesis will define a new RGB contract and\nthe assets under different RGB contracts are not fungible. State extensions\nwere created exactly to address this issue. A contract using them may look in\nthe following way:\n-- We need some basic bitcoin-related types\n-- We can do `import BP.{Utxo, RedeemScript, ...}`, but here we'd like to use\n-- this opportunity to showcase how type definitions work\ndata Utxo :: Txid, vout U16\ndata Txid :: [Byte^32]\ndata RedeemScript :: Bytes\ndata CompressedPk :: [Byte^33]\ndata XonlyPk :: [Byte^32]\ndata OutputDescriptor :: Wpkh | Tr\ndata Wpkh :: CompressedPk\ndata Tr :: XOnlyPk\n\ndata ProofOfBurn ::\n  burned Utxo,\n  descriptor OutputDescriptor\n  -- output descriptor is used to prove that the bitcoins can't be spent.\n  -- in the validation logic below we define that PoB output must be either\n  -- SegWit v0 WPKH or taproot output with a keypath-spending; in both cases\n  -- the key given as a prove must be tweaked with its own hash, which will\n  -- construct provably-unspendable key\n\nschema RgbWrapBtc\n  global Ticker :: String\n  global Name :: String\n\n  owned Value :: Zk64 -- the assets will be ownable and transferrable as any\n                      -- other fungible asset\n\n  valency Burn -- the valency declares a possibility of the public \n               -- participation in the contract logic.\n               -- If the contract may have different forms of public \n               -- participation, each of them must be declared first.\n\n  genesis :: Ticker, Name, -- in genesis we can't issue anything, we just\n                           -- declare specific name and ticker for our wrapped\n                           -- bitcoin\n             Burn -- we also say that the genesis allows state extensions to\n                  -- be directly linked to the contract\n\n  -- this is the state extension procedure: a \"public\" method of the contract\n  -- which takes information about the proof of burn and allows to issue the\n  -- wrapped bitcoins assigned to a single-use-seal(s), which are lately can\n  -- be transferred with a usual state transition.\n  public Issue :: Burn, proof ProofOfBurn -&gt; issued [Value]\n    -- here we verify that the UTXO input constructed with the key given in\n    -- the proof according to the provably-unspent procedure exactly matches\n    -- output existing onchain\n    let spk' = match proof.descriptor\n      Wpkh(pk) =&gt;\n        pk |&gt;\n        Hash.sha256 |&gt;              -- h = Hash.sha256 pk\n        SECP.gen |&gt;                 -- tweak = SECP.gen h\n        SECP.add pk |&gt;              -- pk' = SECP.add pk, tweak\n        Hash.hash160 |&gt;             -- h' = Hash.hash160 pk''\n        BP.wpkhScriptPubkey         -- BP.wpkhScriptPubkey h'\n      Tr(xpk) =&gt;\n        xpk |&gt;\n        BIP340.selfTweak |&gt;         -- xpk' = BIP340.selfTweak xpk\n        BP.trScriptPubkey           -- BP.trScriptPubkey xpk'\n\n    let spk = assert BP.readScriptPubkey proof.burned\n    assert spk == spk'\n    assert BP.notSpent proof.burned\n    assert BP.value proof.burned == sum issued\n\n  op Transfer :: spent {Value} -&gt; received [Value]\n    assert sum spent == sum received\n\n","id":"https://rgb.tech/program/contractum/fungibles/","title":"Adding fungible state"},"https://rgb.tech/program/contractum/interfaces/":{"body":"But how the wallet makes the sense of the contract? RGB contract can do a lot of things, and if schema developers would need to do a separate wallet for each schema the entrance threshold would be too high. To avoid such situation a concept of contract interface was created. A contract interface is a standard way communicating with RGB Node asking it for a semantically-meaningful state and creating operations. Such concept of interface is similar to the concept of ERC standards and ABI files in Ethereum world; the most common interfaces are called \"RGBxx\" and are defined as a separate LNP/BP standards.\nHere, instead of using existing interface standards we will create an interface for a generic fungible token from scratch to explain the way they work:\ninterface FungibleToken:\n   global Ticker -&gt; String -- this is similar to schema definition; in fact\n                           -- it is a requirement that the schema must provide\n                           -- a global state of the String type and link it to\n                           -- the \"Ticker\" name\n   global Name -&gt; String\n\n   -- amount of the issued asset must be a owned state which should be \n   -- accessible to all contract participats, hence it is `public`\n   owned public Inflation :: Zk64\n   owned Asset :: Zk64\n\n   op Issue :: Inflation -&gt; [Asset]?, Inflation? -- and operations\n   op Transfer :: {Asset} -&gt; [Asset]\n\n-- Specific schema state may use different naming, for instance because a \n-- schema can define multiple assets with different names; in that case we \n-- will have multiple interface implementations referencing different state.\nimplement FungibleToken for DecentralizedIdentity\n   global Ticker := IOYTicker -- this creates a _binding_ of the state defined\n                              -- in the schema (*IOYTicker* in this case) to\n                              -- the interface\n   global Name := IOYName\n   owned Inflation := IOYIssue\n   owned Asset := IOYTokens\n   op Issue := Promise\n   op Transfer -- here we skip `:=` part since the interface operation name\n               -- matches the name used in the schema. In such cases we can \n               -- also skip the declaration at whole\n\nRGB smart contract can implement multiple interfaces. In our case it would be\ndesirable to expose the identity information as well:\ninterface PgpIdentity\n  owned Identity :: PgpKey\n  exec Revocation :: old Identity -&gt; new Identity\n\nimplement PgpIdentity for DecentralizedIdentity\n  -- we do not need to put anything here since schema state and operation\n  -- names matches interface requirements and the compiler is able to guess\n  -- the bindings\n\n","id":"https://rgb.tech/program/contractum/interfaces/","title":"Contract interfaces"},"https://rgb.tech/program/overview/":{"body":"Contract business logic in RGB is defined through so-called schema; the \nspecific RGB contract must implement some schema. One may think of a schema \nas a \"class\" definition in the OOP world; in that terms specific RGB contracts \nare \"class instance\" created by the schema constructor (genesis operation). \nSuch approach allows to separate role of contract developer (in RGB called \nschema developer) and contract issuer: the first one needs to be an \nexperienced developer, while the second one is not required to know anything \nabout coding or security at all. This also promotes re-use of common codebase by\ndifferent issuers for the same typical use cases (like fungible assets), \nreducing the risk of mistakes.\nRGB uses specially-designed virtual machine AluVM, which is Turing-complete in\nthe same terms as EVM and WASM-based smart contracts (i.e. nearly computational\nuniversal, but is bound by number of operation steps, measured by gas \nconsumption in Ethereum-like systems, and by accumulated computational \ncomplexity measure in case of AluVM).\n","id":"https://rgb.tech/program/overview/","title":"Overview of RGB development"},"https://rgb.tech/program/rust/":{"body":"Work in progress – please check this section later.\n","id":"https://rgb.tech/program/rust/","title":"RGB in Rust"},"https://rgb.tech/program/ways/":{"body":"Today, there are two main ways for programming RGB smart contracts: using\nrust-based RGB domain-specific language and with a specially-designed functional\nsmart contract language named Contractum.
